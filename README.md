# Gymnasium integration for the DeepMind Control (DMC) suite

A lightweight integration into Gymnasium which allows you to
use DMC as any other gym environment. The core idea here was 
to keep things minimal and simple. The wrapper has no complex
features like frame skips or pixel observations. Instead, such
functionality can be derived from Gymnasium wrappers.
